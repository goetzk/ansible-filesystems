Filesystems
===========

Basic management of filesystems.

Requirements
------------

This role requires at least the following filesystems (and that they have a
label applied before use).
* Root filesystem (to be marked read only)
* Home filesystem (which will remain r/w)
* var filesystem  (which will remain r/w)

If you wish you could partially work around the requirement for the second r/w
partition by making home and var the same filesystem by bind mounting them
before running this role.

If the role is run without updating filesystems_configuration_mounted to
'mounted' filesystems will need to be manually remounted or the server rebooted
to pick up the new configuration. The current setting is the safe default.

The role isn't comprehensive - there are other things living in /etc/ that need
moving which might affect you - I'm happy to update the role if you encounter
any.

Role Variables
--------------

# Read only filesystems
filesystems_configuration_ro: []
# noexec filesystems
filesystems_configuration_noexec: []
# Present updates configuration. Set to 'mounted' to have filesystems remounted
# at once, see mount module docs for explanation and other options
filesystems_configuration_mounted: 'present'
# Move roots home
filesystems_ro_move_root: true

# These two are set per ansible_distribution; these are Debians settings as its
# the only currently enabled distribution.
# Options for filesystems mounted noexec
filesystems_noexec_opts: 'noexec,nosuid'
# Options for filesystems mounted read only
filesystems_rofs_opts: 'ro,data=writeback,errors=remount-ro'

# Enable if you have LVM and need it moved
filesystems_with_lvm: false

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      vars:
       - filesystems_configuration_ro:
         - { name: '/', label: 'ROOTFS', filesystem: 'ext4' }
       - filesystems_configuration_noexec:
         - { name: '/tmp', label: 'TEMPFS', filesystem: 'tmpfs'}
       - filesystems_ro_move_root: true
      roles:
         - { role: goetzk.filesystems }
